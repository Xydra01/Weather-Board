# Weather Board

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I created this app tolearn my way around the OpenWeatherMap Api while also getting myself a nice weather app in process. I built this in hopes that I'd be able to use this as a basis for future projects of mind, but also for other to maybe get a feel for how the API can be used. I learned quite a lot making this app, and I can already think of ways to implement things i did in this project in other projects.

## Usage

To use the app simply input a name of a city. The app will select the most relevent result and display the current weather and a forcast for the next 5 days.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
